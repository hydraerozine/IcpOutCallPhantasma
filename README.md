# `apioutcall`

Welcome to APITOUTCALL. Here i am working on establishing a secure HTTPS outcall to servers that are not supported by ICP fusion. We are basically letting servers know of events that happen within ICP when a user connects a wallet and decides to do an operation across any chain. Instead of letting the server waste resources listening to events emitted on the network, we are letting ICP send out data when the event occurs. In this case we are testing this to support phantasma blockchain when a user on ICP or binance smart chain decides to send CIT to phantasma
